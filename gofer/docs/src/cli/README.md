# Command Line

Gofer's main way of providing interaction is through a command line application included in the Gofer binary.

This command line tool is how you upload pipelines, view runs, upload artifacts and many other common Gofer tasks.

To view the possible commands for the Gofer pipeline simply run `gofer --help`.
