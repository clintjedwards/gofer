# Gofer's Philosophy

## Short version

Gofer focuses on the usage of containers to run workloads that don't belong as long-running applications. At it's core,
it is a remote code execution platform. The ability to run containers _easily_ is powerful tool for users who need to
run various short-term workloads and don't want to learn a whole new paradigm to do it. Gofer respects the user by
inviting them to follow a golden path for how to do things, but also giving them the power to leave it when necessary.

Gofer's core values are:

- Simple as possible, but no simpler.
- Easy to use. Don't get in the way of the user.
- Fast. Computers wait on people not the other way around.
