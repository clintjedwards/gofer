# Installing Gofer

Gofer comes as an easy to distribute pre-compiled binary that you can run on your machine locally, but you can always build Gofer from [source](#from-source) if need be.

## Pre-compiled (Recommended)

You can download the latest version for linux here:

```bash
wget https://github.com/clintjedwards/gofer/releases/latest/download/gofer
```

## From Source

```bash
cd gofer
cargo build --release
```
