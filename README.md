Gofer is an opinionated, streamlined automation engine designed for the cloud-native era. It's basically remote code execution as a platform.

It specializes in executing your custom scripts in a containerized environment, making it versatile for both developers and operations teams. Deploy Gofer effortlessly as a single static binary, and manage it using expressive, declarative configurations written in real programming languages. Once set up, Gofer takes care of scheduling and running your automation tasks—be it on Nomad, Kubernetes, or even Local Docker.

Its primary function is to execute short-term jobs like code linting, build automation, testing, port scanning, ETL operations, or any task you can containerize and trigger based on events.

## Features:

- **Simple Deployment**: Install Gofer effortlessly with a single static binary and manage it through its intuitive command-line interface.
- **Language Flexibility**: Craft your pipelines in programming languages you're already comfortable with, such as Go or Rust—no more wrestling with unfamiliar YAML.
- **Local Testing**: Validate and run your pipelines locally, eliminating the guesswork of "commit and see" testing.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend Gofer's capabilities by writing your own plugins, backends, and more, in any language via OpenAPI.
- **Built-In Storage**: Comes with an integrated Object and Secret store for your convenience.
- **DAG Support**: Harness the power of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for complex workflow automation.
- **Robust Reliability**: Automatic versioning, Blue/Green deployments, and canary releases ensure the stability and dependability of your pipelines.

## Documentation & Getting Started

If you want to fully dive into Gofer, check out the [documentation site][website-url]!

## Install

Extended installation information is available through the [documentation site](https://clintjedwards.com/gofer/guide/installing_gofer.html).

### Download a specific release:

You can [view and download releases by version here][releases-url].

### Download the latest release:

- **Linux:** `wget https://github.com/clintjedwards/gofer/releases/latest/download/gofer`

### Build from source:

1. `git clone https://github.com/clintjedwards/gofer && cd gofer`
2. `make build`
3. `ls ./target/release/gofer`

The Gofer binary comes with a CLI to manage the server as well as act as a client.

## Dev Setup

Gofer is setup such that the base run mode is the development mode. So simply running the binary
without any additional flags allows easy auth-less development. You can read more about how to deploy Gofer in a
production environment [here](https://clintjedwards.com/gofer/ref/server_configuration/index.html)

### You'll need to install the following first:

To run Gofer dev mode:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Run from the Makefile

Gofer uses flags, env vars, and files to manage configuration (in order of most important). The Makefile already includes all the commands and flags you need to run in dev mode by simply running `make run`.

In case you want to run without the make file simply run:

```bash
cd gofer
export GOFER_WEB_API__LOG_LEVEL=debug
cargo run --bin gofer -- service start
```

### Editing OpenAPI spec files

#### Where are the openapi spec files?

Gofer uses OpenAPI to generate a REST API in which is uses both to communicate with extensions and the main web service.

- You can find the OpenAPI spec files located in `sdk/openapi.json` and `gofer/docs/src/assets/openapi.json`.
- This means you can also access the API reference by going to `/docs/api_reference.html` in the main web service.

#### How do we generate new spec files?

Gofer uses [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen) to generate the Golang sdk and [progenitor](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor) to generate the Rust SDK.

You can download oapi-codegen by performing `go install github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/v2/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest`.
Progenitor is already included as a lib within the generation code.

The OpenAPI Spec files are generated by the web framework used [dropshot](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/). It
generates the files directly from the code.

You can run the generate script by using `make generate-openapi` from the root directory.

### Editing Documentation

Documentation is done with [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

To install:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-linkcheck
```

Once you have mdbook you can simply run `make run-docs` to give you an auto-reloading dev version of the documentation
in a browser.

### Regenerating Demo Gif

The Gif on the README page uses [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs); a very handy tool that allows you to write a configuration file which will pop out
a gif on the other side.

In order to do this VHS has to run the commands so we must start the server first before we regenerate the gif.

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/gofer* # Start with a fresh database
make run # Start the server in dev mode
cd documentation/src/assets
vhs < demo.tape # this will start running commands against the server and output the gif as demo.gif.
```
